  caveats <<~EOS
    IMPORTANT NOTICE:

    Apple requires developers to pay $100/year for app notarization. 
    
    As a small developer, this cost is significant, so this app has not been notarized.

    As a result, macOS Gatekeeper might block the app. You can bypass this restriction using one of the following methods:

    1. Via Finder:
      - Right-click the app in Finder.
      - Select "Open" to allow it to run.

    2. Via Terminal:
      - Run the following command to remove the Gatekeeper quarantine attribute:
        ```
        xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Blink\ Eye.app
        ```

    Your understanding and support for independent developers like me are greatly appreciated! ğŸ’¡
