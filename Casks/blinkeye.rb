    ### **Important Notice**
    Apple requires developers to pay **$100/year** for app notarization. As a small developer, this cost is significant, so this app has not been notarized.

    As a result, macOS Gatekeeper might block the app. You can bypass this restriction using one of the following methods:
    
    1. **Via Finder:**  
       - Right-click the app in Finder.  
       - Select **"Open"** to allow it to run.
    
    2. **Via Terminal:**  
       - Run the following command to remove the Gatekeeper quarantine attribute:  
         ```bash
         xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Blink\ Eye.app
         ```

    Your understanding and support for independent developers like me are greatly appreciated! ğŸ’¡
